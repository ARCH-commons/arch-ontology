## This is *NOT* updated to the latest ontology release!

To be used by the forthcoming i2b2 MetaData Loader, for easy first-time installation of ontology files...

If you are not doing a first time installation,
	1. back up your table_access table.
	2. delete the records in the original table_access table for tables that you want to re-install.
