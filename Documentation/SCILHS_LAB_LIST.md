# List of Labs to Map

Below is a list of all lab types that need to be mapped. Each of these is a folder in the ontology with several LOINC codes. (Note that the tree also contains HIV tests, which are inactivated because queries on these data without specific approval is illegal in Massachusetts. You do not need to map these codes.)
